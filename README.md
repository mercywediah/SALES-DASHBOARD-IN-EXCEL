INSIGHTS
The dashboard was focused on Product J hence all charts are geared towards deriving insights for it.
From the pie chart of product J with regards to the Sales Data in terms of quarters in the year, there was an improvement in total sales from the first quarter to the third quarter.
However, there was a decline of total sales in the last quarter of the year which is not healthy for productivity and company growth and from the data, there were some hitches and unproductivity from some sales persons and some stores.
